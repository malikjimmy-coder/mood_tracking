# Mood Tracking

A production-grade Flutter application for tracking mood, workouts, and daily wellness insights. Built with the MVC pattern using Riverpod for state management. Pixel-matched to the supplied design specs across home dashboard, training calendar, and an interactive mood wheel.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [FVM](https://fvm.app/) installed
- Flutter `3.35.4` (Dart `3.9.2`) provisioned via FVM (`.fvmrc` already pins this)

### Install & Run

```bash
fvm flutter pub get
fvm flutter run
```

### Build APK

```bash
fvm flutter build apk --release
```

### Run Tests / Static Analysis

```bash
fvm flutter analyze
fvm flutter test
```

## Architecture Notes

- **MVC layering**: views are pure presentation, controllers (Riverpod `StateNotifier`s) own state and side effects, models are immutable value types.
- **Design tokens only**: every color, text style, dimension, icon path, image path, and string lives in `lib/constants/`. View code references only those tokens.
- **Persistent shell**: `RootScreen` uses `IndexedStack` so screens never rebuild on tab switch, preserving scroll position and animation state.
- **Custom painters**: the mood wheel's gradient ring and the four mood faces (calm / content / peaceful / happy) are rendered via `CustomPainter` — no image assets for the faces.
- **Live time-of-day**: `HomeController` runs a `Timer.periodic(60s)` to flip between sun and moon glyphs based on the device clock.
